 Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
Data structure is data organisation, management and storage format used for afficient access of data.
The basic data structures in python are list, tuple, set and dictionary.
In this project I will focus on list and tuple.
A list is the collection of items seperated by commas in square brackets. List can contain any data type. List is most versatile structure in python.
Python tuples are a type of data structure that is very similar to lists. The main difference between the two is that tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. This makes them ideal for storing data that should not be modified, such as database records.
This project demonstrate the use of list and tuples and their various methods.
The C project has a protype in lists.h header file.
