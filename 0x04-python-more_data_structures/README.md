This project is about data structures in python.
data structures are methods of collecting, organising and storing data for easy and efficient access.
Python has four data structures which is split into two.
mutable: list, dictionary and set
immutable: tuple
This project focuses on the mutable types.
there several function that demonstrate the use of the above data structure and how manipulate data stored in these form.
This project is for both beginner and intermediate python developers.
You use some gerator function such map, filter and reduced which is a bit advanced.
I have added documentation.
