Python - Classes and Objects
A class is a blueprint of a real life entity.
An object is the actual entity.
Variables in a class are given a special name called fields and the functions are methods.
Methods and fields are collectively called attributes.
There are two types of attribute in python.
The class attributes and the instance attributes.
I will try and demonstrate these concepts in the project.
