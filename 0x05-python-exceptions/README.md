Python - Exceptions
Errors in programming refer to issues or defects that arise within the program, resulting in abnormal behavior.
An exception is an unexpected behavior (wrong or not) that occurs during software execution.
In this project I have tried to demonstrate how to handle exceptions in python using the trystatement  and except clause.
try:
some statements
except an exception:
some statements.
